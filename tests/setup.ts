// In this file, we can extend vitest's expect functionality
// with matchers from libraries like @testing-library/jest-dom.
// For example:
// Fix: Import jest-dom matchers for vitest to provide functions like .toBeDisabled()
import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest';

// This setup file runs before each test file.
